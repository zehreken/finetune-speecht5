This is a project to learn about text-to-speech models.
Most code is generated by AI but errors are fixed and scripts are tested.
The projects does not include audio files but there is a helper program that can guide you through the process.

I have recorded 200 voice recordings, just short of 10 minutes in total length. Unfortunately it is not enough to traing SpeechT5 to imitate one's voice. You need at least ~30 minutes of recordings.
