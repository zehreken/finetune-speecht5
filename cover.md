Hello, I'm Guchan. I'm a game programmer with 16 years of experience. I've worked on PC, console and mobile games.
I'm a very curious person by nature. I like thinking in first principles, breaking things down to simpler parts and build again.
I think I'm a great fit for this position on either intermediate or senior level. Given the opportunity I would gladly step up to help building the team and leading afterwards.
Here you are, listening to my cloned voice using Speecht5 model. I thought it would be a fun idea to send my cover letter
in audio format using my cloned voice but I didn't realize how time consuming it would be even to achieve this horrible cloned voice.
You can find the process for how I made this in this blog post.
