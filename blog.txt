I didn't version my work and I lost the order of the sentences
because I didn't read the ai generated code thoroughly and realize
that it generates the sentences in random order. Since I already
recorded the sounds I needed to go through all of them and transcribe
them one by one. It was good though, I at least listened to everything.
